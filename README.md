<b>Additive and Subtractive Principles</b>

Generally, Roman numerals are written in descending order from left to right, and are added sequentially, 
for example MMVI (2006) is interpreted as 1000 + 1000 + 5 + 1.
Certain combinations employ a subtractive principle, which specifies that where a symbol of smaller value 
precedes a symbol of larger value, the smaller value is subtracted from the larger value, and the result is 
added to the total. For example, in MCMXLIV (1944), the symbols C, X and I each precede a symbol of 
higher value, and the result is interpreted as 1000 plus (1000 minus 100) plus (50 minus 10) plus (5 
minus 1).
